# Commerce

An e-commerce auction site built with **Django** that facilitates the buying and selling of items from different users.

## Features
- Interact with other users through the comment forum on each listing
- Place bids on items you are interested in and save those items to your watchlist so you can easily keep track of the price
- Browse different categories to find the perfect item
- Put your own things up for auction and freely close them when you are satisfied with the price

## Inspiration
I created this project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript offered on edX. The premise behind this project was to develop an eBay-like website using the Python web framework Django, with an emphasis on employing Django Models to store data about auction listings, bids, and comments on listings (the full specifications for this project can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/). From this project, I gained a better understanding of data management and also became more proficient with creating Django views and realizing those views through templates.
